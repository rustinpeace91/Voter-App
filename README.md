# Voting-App

"Get Out and Get Involved!" is an application that reaches out to the community to ensure that polling places are staffed with enough people on election day.  The app takes log-in information from managers and users to create user and manager account. Through the manager account, managers can create events, which are posted on the event listing page. Volunteers sign-up for these events and will receive a text message alerting them when election day gets close.  It is more important than ever to get people engaged and involved, and this app gives people a platform to do so.

# Challenges
The challenges for this project were almost entirely git and source related.  We found ourselves running in circles trying to figure out which of our features had been pushed to master and which have not. There were many instances of having to impliment the same feature 3 or 4 times.  While I made plenty of backups of my code, even just trying to rework those old features into the new code was a constant source of errors and debugging. A few file renamings here and there delated a lot of code as well. We will continue to update this over time in hopes that our full vision can be implimented some time in the future.
